## Microcontroller Selection

Selected microcontroller: **ESP-32**

**Rationale:**

- Built-in Wi-Fi and Bluetooth – The ESP32 has integrated 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi and Bluetooth (Classic + BLE), so you don’t need extra communication modules, which reduces cost and board space.

- Powerful and cost-effective – It has a dual-core processor, plenty of GPIOs, ADCs, PWM, SPI, I²C, etc., at a relatively low price.

- Strong ecosystem and support – It’s widely used, has a lot of documentation documentation, and a large community, making work with it faster and easier.

- Good for IoT applications – It supports secure communication (WPA2, TLS, encryption), making it suitable for connected and cloud-based systems.
